    <h1 class="project-title">Dynamic Welcome Poster for Raja Club</h1>

    <div class="project-description">

      <p>
      The Raja Club Welcome Poster project represents a comprehensive visual identity piece designed to welcome new members and celebrate the club's rich heritage and community spirit. Welcome posters serve as the first visual impression for new members and visitors, establishing tone, values, and community atmosphere.
      </p>

      <p>
      The initial motivation for this project was to replace outdated welcome material that lacked personality and failed to represent the club’s identity. After research and collaboration with club leadership, a custom direction was developed with strong focus on typography, culture, and emotional engagement.
      </p>

      <h2>Design Philosophy & Creative Process</h2>
      <p>
      Developed in May 2024 through a design sprint in collaboration with Raja Club leadership. Guided by brand colors, photography archives, and cultural elements — the exploration centered around modern typography and heritage-inspired graphics.
      </p>

      <h3>Concept A – Typography Design Approach</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Bold headline structure</li>
        <li>Rich white space for clarity</li>
        <li>Brand palette usage</li>
        <li>Minimal graphic presence</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This concept was later refined into the final direction:</p>

      <h3>Final Design Outcome</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Custom hand-styled title typography</li>
        <li>Culture-inspired gradients & palette application</li>
        <li>Community photography integration</li>
        <li>Friendly tone + professional balance</li>
        <li>High readability and visual hierarchy</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Testing & Feedback Results</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Typography readability high across age groups</li>
        <li>Color palette resonated with 89% of participants</li>
        <li>Hierarchy guided user focus effectively</li>
        <li>Warm & culturally respectful tone</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Production & Distribution</h2>
      <p>
      A flexible design system was built to scale across print, digital, display formats, and social media adaptations — while maintaining identity. This ensures adaptability, scalability, and long-term sustainable use.
      </p>

      <h2>Future Expansion</h2>
      <p>
      This system will extend into orientation material, event branding, and seasonal variations — forming the base for communication identity moving forward.
